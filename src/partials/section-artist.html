                    <p><a href="https://www.cbtravel.com/technology/" target="_blank">AirPortal</a> is a SaaS product with over 100,000 active users. It has been my life for the last 4 years or so. During that time it’s been through dozens of updates and two complete redesigns.</p>
                    <h5 class="regular">Software as a Service</h5>
                    <p>AirPortal combines massive amounts of user-provided data with global travel information provided by airlines and other sources. Travelers can book travel, manage their preferences, and remain compliant with their corporate travel policy. Managers can oversee travel budgets and policies, and all users are provided up-to-the-minute information regarding emergencies and potential travel delays.  And that's just scratching the surface of everything AirPortal does.
                    <h5 class="regular">Designing the User Experience</h5>
                    <p>UX design is much more than just creating UI mockups. Our design decisions are data-driven using information collected from user testing and analytics tools like <a href="http://domo.com">Domo</a>, <a href="http://pendo.io">Pendo</a> and <a href="http://qualtrics.com">Qualtrics</a>.</p>
                    <p>When I started at Christopherson over 4 years ago I was the first dedicated UX designer on the development team. Having been designed by engineers, the product was functional but not intuitive. None of the layouts in the web application were responsive and the UI was sterile and unintuitive. Many features had been added because, “why not?”</p>
                    <p>Since then we've worked hard to reduce bloat and focused on the needs of the user, rather than capabilities of the architecture. Through the many iterations of the product it's been my job to help ensure the product remains on-brand and in-scope.</p>
                    <p>We’re currently converting our layouts to React, and this has given us an opportunity to further standardize our design libraries.</p>

                    <h5 class="regular">Getting on message</h5>
                    <p>When the old site was an award winner, the update had to be good. Our message had changed and the site needed to reflect that.</p>
                    <p>As with most sites, the message was integral to the design. In the previous site, the most prominent feature of the homepage was a slider with a plane, a hotel, and a rental car. These are things that appeal to the traveler, but our target demographic was actually the independent travel agent.</p>
                    <p>The goal of the site is to entice agents (or independent consultants, as they are known in the industry) to bring their book of clients over to Andavo Travel, and allow us to be their host agency, meaning we would handle vendor contracts, etc.</p>
                    <h5 class="regular">No stock smiley girls</h5>
                    <p>My vision for this site was to make the site as personal as possible. No smiling girls with headsets. No generic stock photography. I wanted to feature real Andavo people and let them tell their stories.</p>
                    <p>At the annual AndavoMart convention, a coworker and I set up a studio space to do interviews. We also shot plenty of b-roll footage to help tell the story. I edited the footage into a series of clips like <a href="https://vimeo.com/250337961" target="_blank">this one.</a></p>
                    <p>Knowing that the videos would be a central feature of the website, I designed the site around the look and feel of the videos.</p>
                    <h5 class="regular">The numbers don't lie</h5>
                    <p>My second goal in the design of the site after having a personal feel, was to present only the most relevant information as concisely as possible. I worked with the marketing department to come up with attention grabbing statistics that could be shown prominently on the homepage.</p>

                    <h3>About this project</h3>
                    <p>One of the major components of AirPortal is the email system. The system sends out around 10,000 emails per day containing everything from traveler itineraries to profile management. When I started at Christopherson the emails were… well there was a lot of work to do, and fortunately I had a lot experience in that arena.</p>
                    <p>In redesigning the emails, I didn’t just trim the fat. I took a chainsaw, blowtorch and jackhammer to it. Knowing that <a href="https://medium.com/@mikenewbry/no-one-wants-to-use-your-product-baf07e4e7b4b">no one really wants more emails in their inbox</a>, my goal was to get straight to the point and either deliver the information or present the call to action in a way that was as clear and concise as possible.</p>
                    <p>I standardized the look of the emails and to ensure the styles remained consistent I created a repository that any developer, current or future, can access with <a href="http://emails.cbtat.com">full documentation</a> on how to modify or add to the project.</p>
                    <p>If you want to know more about how I coded the emails, <a data-open="email2">check this out</a>.</p>
